# SpellChecker
The file words.txt included on the website contains a list of 87,314 English Words. Write a program that uses this word list to implement a simple spell-checker. First, read all of the words into a HashSet&lt;String> object. Then, allow the user to enter the name of a text file that contains written English. The program should output all of the words that are not in the set as potentially misspelled words.
